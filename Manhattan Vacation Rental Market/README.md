## 🏙️ Project 2: Manhattan Vacation Rental Market  
**TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program**

This was the second project I completed as part of the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program. The goal was to apply advanced spreadsheet techniques to analyze Airbnb listings in Manhattan, NYC and provide recommendations to a client looking to invest in short-term vacation rental properties.

### 📊 Overview  
I worked with a **8-tab spreadsheet** to clean, structure, and analyze the dataset. The project involved deep-diving into neighborhood performance, optimal rental sizes, estimated revenues, and several optional pivot table insights. The outcome was a detailed and well-organized spreadsheet that highlighted the most attractive property types and locations for investment.
