# Saving Superstore

This was the fourth project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program.  
It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned about Tableau Visualization.  
The purpose was to consult the company by reviewing the storeâ€™s operations and increase its profitability to avoid bankruptcy.

## Description:
- 9-page Tableau Visualization
- Includes data analysis, charts, and dashboard.

## Process: Joined the sheets
### Part 1: Profit Analysis
- Identified key profit centers and loss-makers by analyzing dimensions like subcategory and region.
- Used visualizations to support conclusions on profitability.
- Determined which products and subcategories should be discontinued based on profitability.

### Part 2: Advertising Effectiveness
- Evaluated optimal combinations of states and months for advertising campaigns.
- Calculated average profit per unit sold to determine an appropriate advertising budget.

### Part 3: Return Rate Analysis
- Analyzed product and customer return rates.
- Created visualizations to identify products and customers with the highest return rates.
- Explored the relationship between average profit and return rate on selected dimensions to inform strategic decisions.


## Data:
The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:

- **Superstore.xls**: Each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd.
  - **orders**: Details all fields for each ordered item.
  - **returns**: Details all fields for each returned item.
 

## Assumptions:
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- The operations department will need to make changes.
- The advertising department needs recommendations.

## Findings and Recommendations:

## Findings:
- **Subcategories profit centers**: Copiers, Phones, and Accessories while **loss centers** are Tables, Bookcases, and Supplies based on profits.
- **Profit Centers** are Office Supplies and Technology in the West Region while **loss centers** are Office Supplies and Furniture in the Central Region based on profits.
- Several products are causing negative profits, some as high as $20k in losses.
- **Advertising campaigns** should be targeted towards Indiana in October, Vermont in November, and Washington in March.
- **Returns** are a serious problem with many products having high return rates, as high as 100%.
- There are several customers with high return rates, as high as 100%.
- When considering **average profits vs return rate**, there are a few individual products that are not worth selling and many products left to consider continuing or not.

## Recommendations:
- Continue to optimize sales and marketing efforts in **profit centers** to maintain profitability. Invest in marketing and product development to further capitalize on their success.
- Conduct a thorough analysis to identify the underlying reasons for losses. Consider product adjustments, pricing strategies, or operational changes to improve performance. If these products consistently generate negative profits, consider discontinuing them.
- Investigate products with negative profits. If these products consistently generate negative profits, consider discontinuing them.
- Target **advertising campaigns** while allocating advertising budgets of 1/5 the state's monthly profits during their most profitable seasons to maximize returns. Consider regional preferences and market trends when designing advertising campaigns.
- Investigate high return rates as this is a significant contributor to negative profits.
- Analyze customer behavior to identify repeat offenders and take appropriate measures to address their concerns and implement customer loyalty programs.
