# SuperStore Returns

This was the fifth project that I worked on in the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analytics Program.  
It was an independent project designed to showcase what I have learned for **Tableau Dashboards** and **Story Telling**.  
The purpose was to prepare an analysis for the CEO of Superstore to help them understand what is causing customers to return their orders and how to reduce the volume of returned orders.

## Description:
- 7 Tableau Visualizations
- 1 Dashboard
- 10-page Story Presentation  
Includes data analysis, charts, dashboard, and Tableau story.

## Process:
1. **Data Joining**: I first joined the sheets.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyzed data using visualizations to determine what is causing returns.
3. **Dashboard Creation**: Built a dashboard for monitoring returns.
4. **Tableau Story**: Created a Tableau story to present my findings.

## Data
The data was one Excel spreadsheet file provided by TripleTen:

- **'Superstore.xls'**: each row corresponds to one product sold; sheets were LEFT JOIN'd  
- **'orders'**: details all fields for each ordered item  
- **'returns'**: details all fields for each returned item  

## Assumptions:
- Profits from sales are totaling in the negative.
- There is one or more causes for negative profits directly related to orders and returns.
- The operations department will need to make changes.

## Conclusions and Recommendations:
